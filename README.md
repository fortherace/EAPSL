The code is mainly designed to be simple and readable. It includes:
* `EAPSL.py`, `PSL.py` and `PSL_with_multihead.py` are the main files corresponding to the implementation and execution of the EAPSL, PSL, and Multi-head PSL algorithms, respectively.
* `model.py` defines the model used in PSL;
* `model1.py` defines the model used in EAPSL;
* `multi_model.py` defines the model used in Multi-head PSL;
* `problem.py` contain all the test problems used in the paper;
* The folder `Algorithms` contains the DN_NSGA2_Survival class, which is a subclass of RankAndCrowdingSurvival for implementing DN-NSGA-II.
* The folder `Result` contains all the results.
